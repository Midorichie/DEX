### Key Components

#### Pool Management
```clarity
(define-map pools
    { token-x: principal, token-y: principal }
    { 
      liquidity: uint,
      balance-x: uint,
      balance-y: uint,
      cumulative-fees: uint,
      last-block: uint,
      reserves-product: uint,
      min-time-between-trades: uint
    })
```

#### Reward System
```clarity
(define-map rewards-info
    { provider: principal }
    { accumulated-rewards: uint, last-update: uint })
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- Node.js (for testing and deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stacks-dex.git
cd stacks-dex
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

### Deployment

1. Deploy core contracts:
```bash
clarinet deploy contracts/dex-core.clar
```

2. Initialize pools:
```bash
clarinet contract-call dex-core create-pool [params]
```

## Usage

### Adding Liquidity

```clarity
(contract-call? .dex-core add-liquidity-v2
    token-x-principal
    token-y-principal
    amount-x
    amount-y)
```

### Performing Swaps

#### Single-Hop Swap
```clarity
(contract-call? .dex-core swap-tokens-v2
    token-x-principal
    token-y-principal
    amount-in
    min-amount-out
    max-price-impact)
```

#### Multi-Hop Swap
```clarity
(contract-call? .dex-core multi-hop-swap
    (list token-a token-b token-c)
    amount-in
    min-amount-out)
```

### Providing Liquidity
